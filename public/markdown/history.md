Logistics the Right Way

Tangen Shipping has since 2000 served local as well as international clients.

We have during this period developed our own profile – a direct and personal approach towards 
clients and suppliers.

With safe and simple logistic solutions, our clients can spend their time doing what they know best – 
producing, buying or selling, and creating and maintaining safe work places.

The staff of Tangen Shipping is highly qualified and motivated to cater for any forwarding challenges 
our clients may have.

As a member of Universal Freight Organization, UFO, we are able to serve any local requirements in 
more than 125 countries and in all major industrial areas and ports around the globe.
